<vspace>
<p>
 Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.

<li><h4><u>Client-Server Concept</u></h4></li>
<p id="client">
The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.
<p>
<h5>How the Client-Server Model works ?</h5>
In this article we are going to take a dive into the Client-Server model and have a look at how the Internet works via, web browsers. This article will help us in having a solid foundation of the WEB and help in working with WEB technologies with ease.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Client:</b> When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
</p>

    <p>
	<b>Servers:</b> Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.
</P>
So, its basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.

<li><h4><u>Components of Web Application</u></h4></li>

Namely, the two structural web app components any web app consists of are client and server sides.

<p>A client is a user-friendly representation of a web app’s functionality that a user interacts with. Written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, it exists within the user’s web browser and doesn’t need any specific OS/device-related adjustments.</p>
<P>
To build a server side you need PHP, Java, .NET, Python, Ruby on Rails or Node.js development skills. This side usually consists of at least two more parts: web server with app logic (or the main control center) and database (storage of all persistent data). If you scale up this side, it means that you increase the number of web servers and databases to boost your web app’s performance and stability.</p> 
<p id="type">
<li><h4><u>Types of Web Content</u></h4></li>

There are 7 types of high-quality web content that can please website visitors and keep them coming back for more.
<ol>

<li><h5>Blogs</h5></li>

Blogging is an invaluable tool for driving visitors to your website, and building awareness about you and your brand.

Generally written from a more personal and informal point of view than content assets, a blog is a great way to connect with readers. It is the perfect vehicle for providing them with information that not only answers a question or solves a problem, but also helps to establish you as a trusted authority on the topic.

Blogs are also a great way to keep your web content fresh, enabling you to post new content on a regular basis and helping you continue to rank in SERPs (search results).

<li><h5>Content assets</h5></lI>

This broad category of web content includes collateral and similar resources you have already invested in and can now repurpose to help draw visitors to your website.

Some examples are product brochures, user manuals, slide presentations, white papers, industry reports, case studies, fact sheets, ebooks, webinars, and podcasts.

The goal is to extend the value of these assets by using them across different digital media and channels. The content can be broken up into smaller pieces and distributed in new ways, such as via blog posts, tweets, video clips, email blasts, search engine ads, and other channels.

<li><h5>Calls to action</h5></li>

A call to action (CTA) is a prompt designed to get your website visitor to take some immediate action, such as make a purchase or get more information.

In addition to having CTAs on your web pages, you can include them in other marketing content you use to drive traffic to your website, such as blogs, emails, social media posts, and e-newsletters.

A CTA may take your web visitor to a landing page for further action.

Whatever your CTA is, it is important that the intent is clear and your audience has a good idea what to expect. After all, you don’t want lose visitors by having them click on a link that takes them somewhere they really don’t want to go.

<li><h5>Landing pages</h5></li>

Landing pages are destinations — the web pages where visitors are sent when they click on a hyperlink, such as a search engine result, a social media ad, a CTA, or a special offer on your website.

These pages are designed to help you convert website visitors into leads by providing a way to capture their contact information.

For example, suppose you want to build your authority as an SME by offering a free white paper to your website visitors. When they click on the offer link, it can take them to a landing page where the content of white paper is described in more detail and they can download the paper by submitting an email address.

<li><h5>Testimonials</h5></li>

One of the best ways to appeal to prospects and build credibility is with relatable success stories from their peers. That is what makes customer testimonials such valuable web content.

Whether your goal is to create formal case studies, include real-life customer scenarios in a white paper, or post short video clips on Twitter or Facebook, having a process in place to identify happy customers and capture their feedback is a great idea.

TIP: Don’t hide all your valuable customer feedback on one testimonials page. Include testimonials throughout your site to serve as social proof that validates your claims.

<li><h5>Video & audio content</h5></li>

With the ability to embed video and audio clips so that anyone can view and listen without leaving the webpage, digitally recorded media are increasingly popular web content tools. It is a great way to offer content such as how-tos, webinars, podcasts, and seminars.

<li><h5>Visual content</h5></li>

According to the Social Science Research Network, 65% of people are visual learners. So, it makes good sense to incorporate visual web content into your website.

In addition to having a graphic design that helps to convey the flavor and purpose of your brand, you can:

    Use images — preferably original ones — to break up and enhance the text
    Create videos to entertain and inform
    Reiterate key information in a concise way through infographics
    Create your own memes to make important messages more memorable
    Offer presentations for visitors who want details in a more graphic, bulleted format
    Include screenshots to clearly show things that may be difficult to explain in words

<li><h4><u>Overview of HTTP-HTTP request-response</u></h4></li>
<img src="http.png">
<p>
   HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
</p>
A Web document is the composition of different resources
<p>
Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.
</p>
<p>
HTTP as an application layer protocol, on top of TCP (transport layer) and IP (network layer) and below the presentation layer.Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand. 
</p>
</p>
<p id="dynamic">
<li><h4><u>Generation of Dynamic Web Pages</u></h4></li>

A dynamic page displays different content for different users while retaining the same layout and design. Such pages, usually written in CGI, AJAX, ASP or ASP.NET, take more time to load than simple static pages. They’re frequently implemented to show information that changes frequently, e.g., weather updates or stock prices.

Dynamic pages usually contain application programs for different services and require server-side resources like databases. A database allows the page creator to separate the website’s design from the content to be displayed to users. Once they upload content into the database, it is retrieved by the website in response to a user request.

<h5>Two Types of Dynamic Web Pages</h5>

    Client-side Scripting: A web page that changes in response to an action within it (“client-side event”) uses client-side scripting. These scripts generate “client-side content” on the user’s computer, rather than the webserver.<br>
    Server-side Scripting: A web page that changes when it’s loaded or visited, or based on what’s submitted to it, uses server-side scripting. When the pages are loaded, server-side content is generated. Examples include login pages, shopping carts and submission forms.<br>

<h5>How are Dynamic Web Pages Processed?</h5>

When the webserver receives a user request for a dynamic page, it does not send the page directly to the requesting browser as it would do with a static page. Instead, it passes the page to the application server which then completes three activities:<br>

    Read the code on the page<br>
    Finish the page according to the code’s instructions<br>
    Remove the code from the page<br>

This results in a static page that’s passed back to the web server by the application server, and then to the requesting browser for display.

The application server cannot communicate directly with the database, so it requires a database driver that functions as an interpreter and lets the application read and manipulate data that would otherwise be indecipherable.

<p id="app">
<li><h4>
<u>Application server</u></h4></li>


An application server is a server that hosts applications.
<p>
Application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers. An application server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them.
</p>
<p>
An application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model. It includes a set of components accessible to the software developer through a standard API defined for the platform itself. For Web applications, these components usually run in the same environment as their web server(s), and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages. However, many application servers do more than generate web pages: they implement services such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing, so developers can focus on implementing the business logic.<br>
</p>
<P>
In the case of Java application servers, the server behaves like an extended virtual machine for running applications, transparently handling connections to the database on one side, and, often, connections to the Web client on the other
</p>

<p id="security">
<li><h4><u>Web Security</u></h4></li>
<img src="web.webp">
<p>
    Web security is also known as “Cybersecurity”. It basically means protecting a website or web application by detecting, preventing and responding to cyber threats.
</p>
<p>
Websites and web applications are just as prone to security breaches as physical homes, stores, and government locations. Unfortunately, cybercrime happens every day, and great web security measures are needed to protect websites and web applications from becoming compromised.
</p>
<p>
That’s exactly what web security does – it is a system of protection measures and protocols that can protect your website or web application from being hacked or entered by unauthorized personnel. This integral division of Information Security is vital to the protection of websites, web applications, and web services. Anything that is applied over the Internet should have some form of web security to protect it.
